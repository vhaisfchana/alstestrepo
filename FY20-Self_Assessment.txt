
ALAN CHAN continues to worked with the other VDIF Developers to assist 
the Clozapine Team in troubleshooting connectivity issues with their DEV 
and SQA HealthShare HealthConnect environments.  The connection points are 
from VistA instancesto HealthShare HealthConnect and from HealthConnect 
to MS SQL Server.  ALAN CHAN used his experiences with VistA instances, 
VistA HL7, HealthShare HealthConnect and the Linux OS in identifying the cause
of the connectivity issues.  Examples of such causes are improperly
or malformed VistA HL7 configurations, Firewall rules preventing connectivity
or even the MS SQL Server not running.

ALAN CHAN had extensive amount of data on his previous GFE Laptop.  He migrated
this data onto a new Windows 10 GFE Laptop and re-installed/configured needed
software.

ALAN CHAN assists with office admininistrative duties in the absence 
of an Administrative Officer (AO).  He has also assisted visiting AOs 
from other offices as well as assisted the new Administrative Officer.

ALAN CHAN completed the following HealthShare related training
 of which most were on-site and one was virtual:

Developing Using InterSystems Objects and SQL class
Building and Managing HL7 Integrations
HealthShare Unified Care Record Fundamentals
Managing InterSystems Servers

With technical assistance from Developers Jose Garcia and Steve Owen, 
ALAN CHAN filled out the new DMAG Intake form so that we can get 
an estimate for budgeting for a sandbox in the VA Enterprise Cloud.
The previous form filled out was the EDE Azure Intake form 2.0.

While on the CDC BioSense project, ALAN CHAN produced various reports 
to asist the team in preparing to go to production with the software.
From Forum, he produced VA Facility List for CDC BioSense.
In addition, he produced the Patch Tracking report to identify sites 
that have installed patch VPR*1*20.  This was done to check compliance 
of the installation of a critical patch and crossmatch 
facilities against CDC BioSense Facility list.
Furthermore, ALAN CHAN performed analysis to identify the cause of missing 
or different station numbers, missing diagnosis and missing NPI numbers.
This required reviewing databases and source code.

ALAN CHAN continues to manage 11 Linux VMs and 1 Windows VM that we have at 
IO EDE.  These VMs have been used by VSE and Low Code Developers.  
Other developers have used them to test patches as needed.  These VMs have 
been centrally funded twice.  However, there is no guaratee that these VMs 
will be centrally funded in future fiscal years.  ALAN CHAN has also installed 
HeathShare 2019 on one of these VMs.  In addition, he plans on installing 
HealthConnect as well.  While we have these VMs, we plan to use them 
as a sandbox for Software Engineering Developers.  At least until we can 
acquire funds for a sandbox in another environment such as the VA Enterprise 
Cloud (VAEC).

The VA has several software that depends on Adobe Flashplayer.  Adobe plans 
to end support of the Flashplayer by December 31, 2020.  ALAN CHAN was asked 
to assist in finding alternatives.  He found there are some open source 
alternatives to flash.  However, they are not being updated.  Basically, 
Adobe and the vendors of the more popular browsers are pushing for the use 
of HTML5/WebGL or interactive HTML5.  Adobe still plans to support 
Animate CC as Adobe Animate.  It is just that the browser plug-in will no 
longer be supported.  Therefore, he believes Adobe Animate will still be able 
to publish to HTML 5.  Adobe Flashplayer is a .dll and is considered a security 
risk.  It is not lightweight like HTML5.  Being more CPU intensive, 
it consumes more battery life on mobile devices.  Some of the VA software uses 
Adobe FLEX and Cold Fusion.  He identified that Apache Flex is the replacement 
of Adobe FLEX without the Flash Player.  Apache Royale will allow use 
of ActionScript and output native JavaScript and HTML.  Apache Flex can output 
to mobile and desktop platforms through the Adobe AIR runtime provided 
by Harman.
